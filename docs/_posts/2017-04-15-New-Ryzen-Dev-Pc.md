After many years of using a laptop I have decided to go back to a desktop pc.

My overriding decision for this was based mainly on everything being larger and faster for cheaper. Also I'm a sucker for more cores and AMD Ryzen's offerings and reviews looked really good. 

I had also got into the bad habit of having the laptop in front of the tv, so I was getting neck problems, and watching too much tv as you do.

Over the easter weekend [PBTech](https://www.pbtech.co.nz) Auckland was having a big sale so a perfect time to buy.

### Thoughts

As I am mainly developing I did not need top off the line although you may be mistaken given my parts list.

#### Ryzen CPU

* The Ryzen 5 1600 is more than adequate for my needs and also came with the Wraith cooler whereas than 1600X did not, saving a little bit here.
* The motherboard supports upto the Ryzen 7 1800X so when I feel the pc starting to get a little slow in the next 5 years hopefully the 2-3x speed upgrade should be cheap as chips...

#### Memory

#### LG 29" widescreen

* At work I have 3 monitors, for home to save a little space I went with the LG widescreen as I can have 2 windows open side by side without too much scrolling. 
* Love the inputs of DVI, HDMI and USB-C. The 
* I have a small standing desk so having the the monitor stand was essential to free up space.

#### Graphics card

* Wasn't planning on purchasing the Sapphire graphics card but the Ryzen processor does not have an APU so the motherboards onboard graphics will not work.
* Now I play some games when I find some time.........

#### Case

Was not expecting much from this case as I just said to get the cheapest so was pleasantly surprised.

* Has a black coating all over, so no slicing fingers opening the case...remembering 20+ years ago ouch.
* Like that it has usb ports and power on the top.

### Conclusion

Very happy with purchase and find I am using the PC more productively at home in more than a few years.

#### Future upgrades in a couple of years

* Ryzen 1800x or faster?
* M.2 NVMe SSD drive when the prices drop.
